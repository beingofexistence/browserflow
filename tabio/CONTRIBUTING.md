## TL;DR

- Creating an Issue or Pull Request requires a [GitHub](http://github.com) account.
- Issue reports should be **clear**, **concise** and **reproducible**. Check to see if your issue has already been resolved in the [master](https://github.com/colebemis/tabio/tree/master) branch or already reported in the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/colebemis/tabio/issues).
- Pull Requests must adhere to the existing coding style.
- **IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.

### Bug Reports

A bug is a **demonstrable problem** that is caused by the code in the repository.

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.
2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest version of the extension.
3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; find a way to demonstrate your issue. Provide either screenshots or code samples to show you problem.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

- What is your environment?
- What steps will reproduce the issue?
- What browser(s) versions experience the problem?
- What would you expect to be the outcome?

All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
> 4. Attach screenshots, etc.
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.
Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

<a name="pull-requests"></a>
### Pull Requests

- PRs for bug fixes are always welcome.
- PRs for improving the documentation are always welcome.
- PRs for enhancing the interface are always welcome.

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help.
They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

Follow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the project:

* [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tabio
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory
cd tabio
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/colebemis/tabio
```

* If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

* Create a new topic branch (off of the `master` branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:


```bash
git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
```

* Install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

* Start the webpack build. Webpack will rerun when edits are made:

```bash
npm start
```

* Load the extension:
  * Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
  * Enable `Developer mode` by clicking the checkbox in the top right.
  * Click `Load unpacked extension`.
  * Find and select the `dist` directory of this project.

* Commit your changes in logical chunks. This project adheres to the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages. Running `npm run cm` instead of `git commit` will guide you through the commit process. Use Git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase) feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.


* Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

```bash
git pull [--rebase] upstream master
```

* Push your topic branch up to your fork:

```bash
git push origin <topic-branch-name>
```

* [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.
